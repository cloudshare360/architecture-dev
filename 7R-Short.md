Here are **7 R Cloud Migration Principles on AWS**, based on the well-known **Gartner 5 Rs of Migration** but expanded and tailored for cloud adoption strategies on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:

---
### 1. **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**
### 2. **Replatform ("Lift, Shift, and Optimize")**
### 3. **Refactor / Re-Architect**
### 4. **Repurchase ("Rip and Replace")**
### 5. **Relocate ("Move Somewhere Else")**
- **Description:** Move the entire infrastructure operation to AWS without changing the architecture.
- **Use Case:** Data center exit scenarios where workloads are moved entirely to AWS.
- **AWS Tools:** AWS Outposts, VMware Cloud on AWS, Direct Connect.

### 6. **Retain ("Stay On-Prem")**

### 7. **Retire**

These principles provide a strategic framework to decide how to handle each workload during an **AWS cloud migration journey**, enabling organizations to optimize cost, performance, and innovation.
