Here are **7 R Cloud Migration Principles on AWS**, based on the well-known **Gartner 5 Rs of Migration** but expanded and tailored for cloud adoption strategies on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:

---

### 1. **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**
- **Description:** Move applications to the cloud with minimal or no changes.
- **Use Case:** Quick migration of legacy apps that arenâ€™t due for major updates.
- **AWS Tools:** AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS DMS, EC2, S3.

---

### 2. **Replatform ("Lift, Shift, and Optimize")**
- **Description:** Migrate applications with minor optimizations to take advantage of cloud capabilities.
- **Use Case:** Applications needing slight modifications for better performance or cost-efficiency.
- **AWS Tools:** Amazon RDS, Amazon ECS, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling.

---

### 3. **Refactor / Re-Architect**
- **Description:** Redesign application architecture to fully leverage cloud-native features.
- **Use Case:** Apps requiring scalability, resilience, or modernization (e.g., monolith to microservices).
- **AWS Tools:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, ECS/EKS, Step Functions.

---

### 4. **Repurchase ("Rip and Replace")**
- **Description:** Replace existing software with a commercial or cloud-native solution.
- **Use Case:** Legacy systems that are costly to maintain or can be replaced by SaaS alternatives.
- **AWS Tools:** AWS Marketplace, SaaS offerings, third-party integrations.

---

### 5. **Relocate ("Move Somewhere Else")**
- **Description:** Move the entire infrastructure operation to AWS without changing the architecture.
- **Use Case:** Data center exit scenarios where workloads are moved entirely to AWS.
- **AWS Tools:** AWS Outposts, VMware Cloud on AWS, Direct Connect.

---

### 6. **Retain ("Stay On-Prem")**
- **Description:** Keep certain applications in their current environment instead of migrating.
- **Use Case:** Regulatory constraints, high migration costs, or short lifecycle of the app.
- **AWS Tools:** Hybrid tools like AWS Storage Gateway, Outposts, Snowball Edge.

---

### 7. **Retire**
- **Description:** Decommission applications that are redundant, obsolete, or not providing value.
- **Use Case:** Legacy systems that are no longer needed post-migration.
- **AWS Tools:** No specific tooling required, but audit and discovery tools like AWS Application Discovery Service help identify such apps.

---

These principles provide a strategic framework to decide how to handle each workload during an **AWS cloud migration journey**, enabling organizations to optimize cost, performance, and innovation.
